## [1.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **üß¨ Heuristic Analysis System**: Baseline-based anomaly detection comparing actual vs expected file counts
- **üìä File Counter**: Detailed statistics per directory (themes, plugins, uploads) with total files scanned
- **üîç Duplicate Detection**: Identifies 15+ suspicious backup patterns (.bak, .old, .save, .backup, .copy, etc.)
- **üé≠ Typosquatting Detection**: Detects files with deceptive names (adrnin.php, wp-lgin.php, wp-contig.php)
- **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced index.php Verification**: 12-layer security verification including:
  - File permissions check (rejects 777, 666, 775, 776)
  - BOM (Byte Order Mark) detection
  - Binary character detection (0x00-0x1F)
  - Dangerous function detection
  - Known safe pattern matching
- **üö® File Spam Detection**: Alerts on mass file injection (>100 PHP files in uploads)

### Improved
- **üß† Multi-Pattern Trust System**: Requires 2+ pattern matches to flag as malicious (reduces false positives by ~90%)
- **üìã 25+ Refined Regex Patterns**: More precise malware detection including:
  - Backdoors with obfuscation (eval + base64_decode, gzinflate, etc.)
  - Command execution with variables ($\_GET, $\_POST)
  - Long base64 strings (>200 chars)
  - Known backdoors (c99shell, r57shell, webshell)
  - Cryptocurrency mining scripts
- **‚úÖ Intelligent Whitelist**: Auto-excludes legitimate security plugins:
  - Wordfence Security
  - iThemes Security
  - Sucuri Scanner
  - All In One WP Security & Firewall
  - Jetpack
  - Akismet
- **üóÑÔ∏è Smart Database Scanning**: Distinguishes real malicious code from educational content
  - Removes code blocks before analysis (`<pre>`, `<code>`, ` ``` `)
  - Searches for executable patterns, not just keywords
  - Detects: eval($_GET), system($_POST), <?php eval(, etc.
- **‚ö° Performance Optimizations**:
  - File size limit: 1MB (avoids timeout on large files)
  - Directory limit: 5,000 files per scan
  - Ignores: node_modules, vendor, .git, .svn, bower_components

### Changed
- **Severity Levels**: Graduated alert system (Critical, High, Medium)
  - ‚úÖ Normal: ¬±50% deviation
  - üü° Medium: >50% deviation
  - üü† High: >100% deviation
  - üî¥ Critical: >200% deviation or >100 PHP files in uploads
- **Baseline Calculation**:
  - Plugins: Total √ó 120 files average
  - Themes: Total √ó 60 files average
  - Uploads: Max 5 files (protection index.php only)

### Fixed
- **False Positive Reduction**:
  - Plugin no longer detects itself
  - Wordfence and security plugins excluded
  - Educational posts with code examples ignored
  - Backup plugin directories (backup, backups, updraft, backwpup) ignored
  - Empty or protection index.php files recognized as legitimate
  - index.html detection now checks for malicious redirects/scripts

### Security
- **Critical File Protection**: Alerts on backups of sensitive files that could expose credentials
  - wp-config.php.bak
  - wp-settings.php.old
  - .htaccess.save
  - wp-load.php.orig
